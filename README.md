## Integration

The main tools are currently available as a standalone dialog or tool window. Additionally, some tools are also available via the editor menu or code intentions. Some of these tools are only available if a text is selected, or the current caret position is on a Java/Kotlin string or identifier.

The plugin settings can be found in IntelliJ's settings/preferences under **Tools | Developer Tools**.

### Tool Window

The tool window is available through **View | Tool Windows | Tools**. All inputs and configurations of a tool window will be stored on the project level.

### Dialog

The action to access the dialog is available through IntelliJ's main menu under **Tools | Developer Tools**.

To add the "Open Dialog" action to the main toolbar, we can either enable it in IntelliJ's settings/preferences under **Tools | Developer Tools**, or manually add the action via **Customize Toolbar... | Add Actions... | Developer Tools**.

All inputs and configurations of the dialog will be stored on the application level.

## Versioning

Due to API breaking changes in IntelliJ 2024.2, the plugin will be maintained in two release branches (both will get the same features and bugfixes):

- Release 4.* (maintained in branch `release_4-until-build-2024.1`) until IntelliJ 2024.1.* 
- Release 5.* (maintained in branch `main`) starting from IntelliJ 2024.2.*

The release 4 will be supported until the latest stable Android Studio uses IntelliJ 2024.2. 

## Development

This plugin is not seen as a library. Therefore, code changes do not necessarily adhere to the semantics version rules.

If you want to contribute something, please follow the code style in the `.editorconfig` and sign your commits.
